# Installation Instructions for the C-Parser

This code requires Isabelle2017 and the MLton SML compiler.

To build the main heap CParser, use the following command in this directory (src/c-parser).

    isabelle env make -f IsaMakefile CParser

You can also build a regression test with the command

    isabelle env make -f IsaMakefile CParserTest

## Other Tools

There are two executables that can be built in the standalone-parser directory:

    make standalone-cparser
    make standalone-tokenizer

## Using the C Parser

Theories wishing to use the parser must have CTranslation as an ancestor.
