Check out Check_ShrotestPath_Simpl.thy and try to understand the Simpl implemntation of the checker algorithm. 
This applies for the nonnegative weight cost case.
1. From code we have locale assumptions
2. From locale assumption we have dist = shortest path
From 1 and 2 we conclude the code accepts IF AND ONLY IF it is a shortest path.

TODO:
- Look at check_connected.c
- Reimplement the Shortest Path Simpl Checker in C (nonnegative cost) (Use the Simpl theory file and manually parse)
- Understand how Check_Connected.thy works
